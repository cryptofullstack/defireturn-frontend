          have. <strong>DefiReturn</strong> is a read-only application. It will
          not ask you to sign any transactions, so there is zero-risk to use it.

          Here are some limitations for our initial release:
        </p>
        <ul class="customIndent">
          <li>
            DefiReturn connects to one wallet at a time. We intend to add
            support for multiple wallets in the future.
          </li>
          <li>
            DefiReturn supports five chains: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain,
            Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom. We intend to support others, including
            non-EVM chains, in the future.
          </li>
          <li>
            DefiReturn only analyzes the most recent 2,000 token transfers per
            chain. Note that a single transaction may contain more than one
            token transfer. For example, a Uniswap-style LP deposit transaction
            will typically involve three token transfers: Two tokens are
            deposited and one LP token is received. Older positions that were
            opened more than 2,000 token transfers ago will not show the
            accurate cost basis. We intend to remove this limitation in the
            future in the premium product.
          </li>
          <li>
            DefiReturn does not yet calculate cost for liquid tokens. Instead,
            cost for liquid tokens is presented to be the same as value. If the
            value is not known, both cost and value are presented as $0.
